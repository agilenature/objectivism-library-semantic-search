<objective>
T+36h confirmation check -- verifies the T+24h STABLE verdict was not transient.

Purpose: Final temporal stability proof. Confirms the system remains stable 12 hours after the T+24h gate passed. This is a lightweight check (stability script only) to provide confidence that the gate result is durable.

Output: 12-06-SUMMARY.md with stability confirmation.

CRITICAL PREREQUISITE: This plan MUST be executed in a FRESH Claude Code session.
Run `/clear` before starting this plan.

This is a lightweight check. The T+24h gate (12-05) already did the full verification.
T+36h only needs to confirm the system is still stable.

**Step 1: check_stability.py**
```bash
python scripts/check_stability.py --store objectivism-library
echo "Exit code: $?"
```
Record full output verbatim. Must be exit 0.

**Step 2: Quick DB count verification**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM files WHERE gemini_state='indexed';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM files WHERE gemini_store_doc_id IS NOT NULL;
```
Record and compare to T=0 (from 12-03-SUMMARY.md).

**Step 3: Verdict**
If check_stability exit 0 AND counts match T=0: **T+36h CONFIRMED -- T+24h was not transient**
If check_stability exit != 0 OR counts differ: **T+36h DRIFT -- investigate**

**Step 4: Record in SUMMARY.md**
Write 12-06-SUMMARY.md with:
- T+36h timestamp and hours elapsed since T=0
- check_stability.py output
- DB counts
- Verdict
- Statement: "Phase 12 temporal stability protocol COMPLETE"
  </action>
  <verify>
12-06-SUMMARY.md exists with check_stability output and CONFIRMED verdict.
  </verify>
  <done>
T+36h confirmation completed. T+24h gate verdict confirmed as non-transient. Phase 12 temporal stability protocol complete.
  </done>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>T+36h temporal stability confirmation. Phase 12 is now fully complete pending this final approval.</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Review 12-06-SUMMARY.md
    2. Confirm check_stability.py exit 0
    3. Confirm DB counts match T=0
    4. Confirm verdict is CONFIRMED
    5. Phase 12 is complete -- Phase 13 can proceed

<verification>
1. check_stability.py exit 0 at T+36h
2. DB counts identical to T=0 baseline
3. T+24h verdict confirmed as non-transient
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- check_stability.py exit 0
- DB indexed count = 50 (same as T=0)
- Verdict: CONFIRMED
- Phase 12 temporal stability protocol COMPLETE
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, 12-06-SUMMARY.md IS the artifact for this plan.
Phase 12 is COMPLETE after this plan.
