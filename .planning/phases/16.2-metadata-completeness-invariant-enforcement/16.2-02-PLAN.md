<objective>
Verify the metadata completeness invariant holds across all 1,885 DB-tracked files: run the audit command, confirm exit 0, validate specific files (Bernstein Heroes .md), and confirm Phase 16.3 readiness (MOTM primary_topics at 100%, MOTM scanner topic field at 100%, and Other-stem primary_topics at 100%).

Purpose: Gate check before Phase 16.3 can proceed. The audit command must confirm that every file either has primary_topics or is explicitly skipped with a named reason, and that MOTM scanner topic fields are populated for header injection. This plan is pure verification -- no code changes.

Output: Verified audit passing, specific file checks, Phase 16.3 readiness confirmation.

  <name>Task 1: Run metadata audit and verify all invariant conditions pass</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
**Step 1: Run the audit command and capture output.**
```bash
python -m objlib metadata audit --db data/library.db
echo "Exit code: $?"
```
Expected: All 4 conditions PASS, exit code 0. If exit code is 1, diagnose which condition failed.

**If Condition 1 fails (approved without primary_topics):**
- Query: `sqlite3 data/library.db "SELECT f.file_path, f.ai_metadata_status FROM files f WHERE f.ai_metadata_status = 'approved' AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM file_primary_topics pt WHERE pt.file_path = f.file_path) LIMIT 10"`
- If files are 'extracted' not yet 'approved': run `python -m objlib metadata approve --db data/library.db` then re-run audit.
- If files genuinely lack AI metadata: investigate whether batch-extract missed them. Re-run `python -m objlib metadata batch-extract --db data/library.db` if pending files remain.

**If Condition 2 fails (skipped without reason):**
- Query: `sqlite3 data/library.db "SELECT file_path, ai_metadata_status FROM files WHERE ai_metadata_status = 'skipped' AND (error_message IS NULL OR error_message = '') LIMIT 10"`
- Re-run `python -m objlib metadata mark-unsupported --db data/library.db` if epub files were missed.

**If Condition 3 fails (pending non-enrichable):**
- Query: `sqlite3 data/library.db "SELECT file_path, ai_metadata_status FROM files WHERE ai_metadata_status = 'pending' AND file_path NOT LIKE '%.txt' AND file_path NOT LIKE '%.md' LIMIT 10"`
- Re-run mark-unsupported to catch remaining files.

**If Condition 4 fails (Phase 16.3 readiness):**
- Identify which sub-check failed: MOTM primary_topics, MOTM scanner topic, or Other-stem primary_topics
- For MOTM scanner topic failures: `sqlite3 data/library.db "SELECT file_path, json_extract(metadata_json, '$.topic') FROM files WHERE file_path LIKE '%/MOTM/%' AND ai_metadata_status='approved' AND file_path LIKE '%.txt' AND (json_extract(metadata_json, '$.topic') IS NULL OR json_extract(metadata_json, '$.topic') = '') LIMIT 10"`
- For primary_topics failures: query the specific failing files and determine if they need batch-extract or have a different issue

**Step 2: Verify Bernstein Heroes .md file specifically.**
```bash
sqlite3 data/library.db "SELECT f.file_path, f.ai_metadata_status, GROUP_CONCAT(pt.topic_tag, ', ') as topics FROM files f LEFT JOIN file_primary_topics pt ON f.file_path = pt.file_path WHERE f.file_path LIKE '%Bernstein%' OR f.filename LIKE '%Bernstein%' GROUP BY f.file_path"
```
Expected: The Bernstein Heroes .md file has `ai_metadata_status = 'approved'` and a comma-separated list of primary_topics from CONTROLLED_VOCABULARY.

Also verify the scanner-extracted topic field is present (Phase 16.3 will use this):
```bash
sqlite3 data/library.db "SELECT file_path, json_extract(metadata_json, '$.topic') as topic FROM files WHERE file_path LIKE '%Bernstein%'"
```

**Step 3: Verify no silent-pending files remain.**
```bash
sqlite3 data/library.db "SELECT ai_metadata_status, SUBSTR(file_path, -4) as ext, COUNT(*) FROM files GROUP BY ai_metadata_status, ext ORDER BY ai_metadata_status, ext"
```
Expected: No pending files except possibly failed_validation retries. All .pdf, .html, .docx, .epub should be 'skipped'. All .txt and .md should be 'approved'.

**Step 4: Confirm Phase 16.3 readiness rows.**
Run the audit command output and verify the Phase 16.3 Readiness table shows:
- MOTM primary_topics: 100% coverage (total = with_topics)
- MOTM scanner topic field: 0 files missing (all populated)
- Other-stem primary_topics: 100% coverage (total = with_topics)

If any is below 100%, this is a blocker. Investigate the specific files and run batch-extract on any remaining pending enrichable files.

Additionally, run a spot-check on MOTM quality -- confirm the re-extracted primary_topics are NOT all-boilerplate:
```bash
sqlite3 data/library.db "SELECT f.file_path, GROUP_CONCAT(pt.topic_tag, ', ') as topics FROM files f JOIN file_primary_topics pt ON f.file_path = pt.file_path WHERE f.file_path LIKE '%/MOTM/%' AND f.ai_metadata_status = 'approved' LIMIT 5"
```
Expected: Topics include specific terms beyond the core 5 branches (ethics, epistemology, metaphysics, reason, values). The re-extraction should produce discriminating topics like `immigration`, `capitalism`, `individual_rights`, etc.

Also spot-check that MOTM scanner topic field is populated:
```bash
sqlite3 data/library.db "SELECT file_path, json_extract(metadata_json, '$.topic') as scanner_topic FROM files WHERE file_path LIKE '%/MOTM/%' AND ai_metadata_status = 'approved' AND file_path LIKE '%.txt' ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 5"
```
Expected: Each MOTM file has a non-NULL, non-empty scanner topic (e.g., "Immigration", "Libertarianism", "Axioms").

**Step 5: Record final counts for the summary.**
```bash
sqlite3 data/library.db "
SELECT 'Total files' as metric, COUNT(*) as value FROM files
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Approved with topics', COUNT(*) FROM files f WHERE f.ai_metadata_status = 'approved' AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM file_primary_topics pt WHERE pt.file_path = f.file_path)
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Skipped with reason', COUNT(*) FROM files f WHERE f.ai_metadata_status = 'skipped' AND error_message IS NOT NULL AND error_message != ''
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Pending enrichable', COUNT(*) FROM files WHERE ai_metadata_status = 'pending' AND (file_path LIKE '%.txt' OR file_path LIKE '%.md')
UNION ALL
SELECT 'MOTM with scanner topic', (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM files WHERE file_path LIKE '%/MOTM/%' AND ai_metadata_status='approved' AND file_path LIKE '%.txt' AND json_extract(metadata_json, '$.topic') IS NOT NULL AND json_extract(metadata_json, '$.topic') != '')
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Invariant violations', (
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM files f WHERE f.ai_metadata_status = 'approved' AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM file_primary_topics pt WHERE pt.file_path = f.file_path)
) + (
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM files WHERE ai_metadata_status = 'skipped' AND (error_message IS NULL OR error_message = '')
) + (
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM files WHERE ai_metadata_status = 'pending' AND file_path NOT LIKE '%.txt' AND file_path NOT LIKE '%.md'
)
"
```
Expected: Invariant violations = 0. MOTM with scanner topic = 468.
