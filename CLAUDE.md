## Journal Entries

**MANDATORY: Before writing any journal entry, read `journal/INSTRUCTIONS.md` in full.**

When asked to create or update a journal entry (`journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md`):
1. Read `journal/INSTRUCTIONS.md` before writing anything
2. Follow the required sections: Overview, Starting Point, Root Cause Analysis, Decisions Made, Current State (with cause column), Files Changed, Lessons Learned
3. Apply the anti-amnesia checklist before finalizing the entry
4. Document **causes**, not events — every non-obvious system property must name its cause

The goal is causal chain preservation: a future session reading the entry must understand WHY the system is in its current state, not just WHAT happened.
